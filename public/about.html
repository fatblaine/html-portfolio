<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi there! I'm Chenghao Fan from China.
</p>
<p>
  I'm now a postgraduate student in architecture, a field I was once deeply passionate about. 
  However, the current state of the architecture industry in China is rather stagnant, and the salary it offers is barely enough to make ends meet. 
  Therefore, I taught myself programming and am about to work as a SDE in a manufactorying company this Summer. 
  So, I have interests in fields like art and design, and also have a certain understanding of information technology, and I welcome you to discuss topics in other fields together. 
  By the way, I have plans to continue my studies in Australia, where English is the primary language, next year.
